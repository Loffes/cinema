# Cinema script for FiveM. Standalone.

Simple letterbox/cinema script. It just draws blackbars at top & bottom of your screen.

Clean effect that fades in from the screen. See [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAp_E-blj8o).

This script is based on [malteser_cinema](https://github.com/malteserboi/malteser_cinema). I rewrote it to support all screen sizes (tested on 2560x1440p & 1920x1080p), and added an effect that fades it in.
